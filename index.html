    <h1>SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog</h1>
    <h2>A catalog standard for cloud-native geospatial raster data</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification aims to standardize the way geospatial assets are exposed online and queried. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time. </p>
    <p>The goal is for all major providers of imagery and other earth observation data to expose their data as spatio temporal asset catalogs, so that new code doesn't need to be written whenever a new JSON-based REST API comes out that makes its data available in a slightly different way. This will enable standard library components in many languages.</p>
    <p>STAC itself is a simple specification. It enables a client to search for imagery and other assets across multiple providers.STAC aims to be a core building block of Cloud Native Geospatial architectures to enable a coherent global ecosystem, instead of a number of similar but non-compatible systems.</p>
