Context
The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) is an open specification that evolved from different organizations coming together to increase the interoperability of searching for satellite imagery. When a user wants to search for all the imagery in their area and time of interest they can’t make just one search — they have to use different tools and connect to API’s that are similar but all slightly different. STAC aims to make that much easier, by providing common metadata and API mechanics to search and access geospatial data.

The goal of STAC is to enable a global index of all imagery (satellite, aerial, drone, etc), derived data products and alternative geospatial captures (LiDAR, SAR, Full Motion Video, Hyperspectral, etc). STAC focuses on  an easily implementable standard for organizations to expose their data in a persistent and reliable way.

Why does STAC Matter?
Data providers
STAC is a standardized way to expose collections of spatial temporal data. If you are a provider of imagery and are in need data catalogs, STAC is driving a uniform means for indexing assets.

Developers
If you are building infrastructure to host, ingest, or manage collections of spatial data or image products, STAC’s core JSON is the bare minimum needed to interact with any raster geospatial data collection. Additionally, STAC standardizes metadata fields, naming conventions, query language (coming soon), and catalog structure. It describes individual instances as items containing a link to the physical dataset. The core JSON is fully extensible, allowing developers to add attributes to better capture their use case or dataset. As a developer, there are ways to implement STAC; as a static STAC or the STAC API. The static STAC implementation supports building a catalog webpage of STAC compliant items. This webpage can easily be crawled to build upon, including generate APIS. A STAC API allows for querying data in a standard language and returning a subset of the catalog. STAC eases development of serving or consuming spatial temporal data by instituting standards, making metadata predictable.

Data Users
Consumers of spatial temporal datasets are often burdened with building unique pipelines for ingesting collections into their system. Collections are delivered with varying levels of detail in their metadata and via distinct delivery mechanisms. In an effort to reduce the number this burden, a community of geospatial developers have constructed the STAC spec to remove the need for tailor-made workflows.
