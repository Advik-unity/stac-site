                        	<p>There are exabytes of spatial data in existence today, with the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the world and improve decisions. But most of it remains inaccessible, as it is in a myriad of different formats, with no common way to find relevant information about a place over time. As data migrates to the cloud, we have an opportunity to make it more accessible and interoperable. STAC is a standard and a community of collaborators working to enable increased access to information about our planet. You can learn more about the motivations for the standard on the <a href="why-stac.html">Why STAC?</a> page.</p>
<p>The philosophy of STAC is to focus on making it as easy as possible for data providers to expose their data to the world. Most geospatial catalogs require the provider of data to maintain servers and databases to enable search. This can be a large challenge with huge amounts of data. STAC aims to flip that paradigm on its head, following the path of the web, where putting up an HTML page is very simple, and then the search of those pages can be done by anyone, with experts in search emerging over time. STAC aims to enable that next generation of geospatial search engines, while also supporting web best practices so geospatial information is more easily surfaced in traditional search engines.</p>
<p>The STAC spec itself provides a lowest common denominator JSON format to wrap around any relevant data about the earth. The core <a href="http://geojson.org">GeoJSON</a> object and related structures are designed for extension, so it can adapt to different domains. For more information about the specification, see the <a href="core.html">Spec Overview</a> page. The core JSON pages can be transformed into browsable, interactive HTML pages with tools like <a href="https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser/">STAC Browser</a>. When STAC is used in concert with emerging formats like <a href="http://cogeo.org"</a>Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF</a> the result vastly lowers the barriers for anybody to find and use geospatial assets like satellite imagery:</p>

<p>More than a specification, STAC is a community of collaborators working towards a shared goal. We believe in interoperability, the power of information about the earth, and open data (where it is appropriate). If you'd like to help us in our quest to make spatiotemporal data more accessible don't hesitate to join the community. You can learn about all the ways you can on our <a href="how-to-help.html">How To Help</a> page.</p>

                            <h2>Philosophy of STAC</h2>
                            <p>The driving philosophies behind STAC:
                            <ul><li><b>Small, flexible core</b>  -  STAC aims to be easy to implement, and adaptable to existing implementations. STAC validation enables maximum flexibility by simply checking for the presence of key fields, allowing other implementation specific fields to be consumed by STAC clients as required.</li>
                                    <li><b>Evolve best practices and extensions through real world use</b> - While the STAC Core focuses on minimal specification, optional extensions will be introduced to increase interoperability and usability of data exposed via STAC. These will arise from concrete STAC implementations.</li>
                                    <li><b>Heavy use of Links</b> - Links between various items enable modeling of complex relationships. Links allow a client to traverse relationships across different STAC implementations. For example, a derived NDVI product produced by Company A should link to the corresponding surface reflectance data provided by Company B.</li>
                                    <li><b>HTML representations</b> - JSON allows human readable representations of STAC Items, in both Static STAC and STAC API implementations. JSON allows STAC to be easily transformed into HTML.</li></ul></p>

                            <h2>Features of STAC</h2>
                            <h3>Metadata for Imagery on the Cloud:</h3>
							<p>The <a href="http://www.cogeo.org/">Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)</a> is the most fundamental building block of the Cloud Native Geospatial world, enabling platforms to stream information between one another. But COG’s by themselves don’t have enough information to be crawled and indexed in any meaningful way without some other structure providing links and additional information.</p>
                            <p>Pairing a COG with a STAC Item provides all the additional metadata to make it useful, and the link structure of the Catalog ensures that search engines will be able to crawl it. By using HTML to render STAC Items, every COG can have an online location that users can interact with and can discover via search engines. Though COG is the ideal pair for a STAC Item, STAC can be used with any format - the only requirement is that it is an asset that can be downloaded.</p>
                            <p>Simply putting data on the cloud is not sufficient — it must be discoverable and useable. STAC offers a simple and reliable way to make data more accessible.</p>

                            <h3>Tracking Provenance Across Catalogs</h3>
                            <p>Creating a true Cloud Native Geospatial ecosystem requires not just provenance tracking within one cloud platform, but across all platforms. An algorithm might access Orthorectified Satellite imagery from a data provider via STAC, then apply surface reflectance, run an NDVI to assess plant health, or create a land cover classification. If the resulting outputs are also distributed with own STAC then the data can refer to the parent STAC Items to allow provenance tracking across platforms.</p>

                            <h3>Flipping the Geospatial Search Paradigm</h3>
                            <p>While everyone is familiar with Google and being able to search across every web page in the world, this is still not possible for geospatial data. The vision for STAC is for global search is not to send search requests to every STAC server, but to just make every item ‘web-crawlable’.</p>
							<p>Provenance links between catalogs contribute to discoverability by boosting a page’s ranking within search engine algorithms. Stable HTML means more links to those pages, which will push them higher in search results.</p>
							<p>STACs create a foundation for geospatial search innovation by standardizing metadata for imagery, promoting other Cloud Native Geospatial technologies like COG, and encouraging HTML pages with lots of links for every single geospatial image.</p>
